excerpt: "**Deglaciation-enhanced mantle CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes at Yellowstone imply positive climate feedback.**
We model how the deglaciation of the Yellowstone ice cap caused a reduction in mantle pressures and enhanced melting 19-fold. We predict the additional melting segregates a globally-significant mass of CO<sub>2</sub>, potentially playing a role in positive feedbacks between deglaciation and climate. We suggest enhanced melting may be important in other magmatically-active, continental settings undergoing rapid deglaciation --- for instance, under the collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS).
