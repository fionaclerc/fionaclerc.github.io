excerpt: "**Marine Ice Cliff Instability mitigated by slow removal of ice shelves.** The Marine Ice Cliff Instability posits ice cliffs above a critical height collapse under their own weight, initiating runaway ice sheet retreat. We model the formation of marine ice cliffs, as an Antarctic ice shelf is removed. We show that over ice-shelf collapse timescales longer than a few days (consistent with observations), ice cliffs comprised of intact ice are more stable, undergoing viscous flow rather than brittle fracture.
