excerpt: "**Folds and fractures at the McDonald Ice Rumples constrain ice rheology and criterion for failure.** We model deformation at the McDonald Ice Rumples (MIR), formed as the Brunt Ice Shelf is grounded into a bathymetric high. The MIR are characterized by concentric folds intersected by radial fractures, implying viscous and brittle behavior, respectively. We interpret these features to constrain ice rheology and strength. <br/> <br/> <img width='100%' src='/images/rumple_evolution_2d.pdf'> "
