excerpt: "**Convection rolls in subglacial groundwater imply elevated geothermal heat flow at the base of the Antarctic Ice Sheet.** The geothermal heat flux (GHF) imparted to the base of the Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) governs ice flow. We raise the possibility that if subglacial groundwater is abundant in sedimentary basins found beneath the AIS, this water can undergo hydrothermal convection. We model the formation of these convection rolls ---  our findings imply that in many locations, the heat flow felt by the base of the ice sheet is elevated relative to that inferred geophysically.  <br/> <img width='100%' src='/images/conv_roll_fig.png'>  <br/>"
