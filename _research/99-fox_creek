excerpt: "**Stress drop estimates and hypocenter relocations of induced seismicity near Crooked Lake, Alberta.** Human-induced earthquakes due to subsurface fluid injection pose a potential risk to surrounding populations. To understand how these induced earthquakes may differ from naturally occurring tectonic earthquakes, we characterize a sequence of earthquakes near Fox Creek, Alberta, likely induced by hydraulic fracturing.
