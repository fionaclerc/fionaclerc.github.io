excerpt: "**Predicting rates and distribution of carbonate melting in oceanic upper mantle: Implications for seismic structure and global carbon cycling.** We predict how small concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> found in passively upwelling mantle throughout ocean basins may generate low-degree carbonate melting. We find the flux of CO<sub>2</sub> segregated by these melts rivals the flux from mid-ocean ridges.
