My [research](https://fionaclerc.github.io/research) uses geodynamic models to study processes within the Earth's mantle and cryosphere, and their connections.

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford University. Before this, I completed a postdoc at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. I received a Ph.D. in Geophysics, conferred jointly by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.

Starting Jan. 2026, I will be an Assistant Professor at the Department of Geosciences at Stony Brook University. I am looking to grow my group with Ph.D. students and a postdoc, please get in touch if you are interested.
