My research uses geodynamic models to study processes within the Earth's mantle and cryosphere, and their connections.

**Folds and fractures at the McDonald Ice Rumples constrain ice rheology and criterion for failure.**
We model deformation at the McDonald Ice Rumples (MIR), formed as the Brunt Ice Shelf is grounded into a bathymetric high. The MIR are characterized by concentric folds intersected by radial fractures, implying viscous and brittle behavior, respectively. We interpret these features to constrain ice rheology and strength.

**Deglaciation-enhanced mantle CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes at Yellowstone imply positive climate feedback.**
We model how the deglaciation of the Yellowstone ice cap caused a reduction in mantle pressures and enhanced melting 19-fold. We predict the additional melting segregates a globally-significant mass of CO<sub>2</sub>, potentially playing a role in positive feedbacks between deglaciation and climate. We suggest enhanced melting may be important in other magmatically-active, continental settings undergoing rapid deglaciation --- for instance, under the collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS).

**Marine Ice Cliff Instability mitigated by slow removal of ice shelves.**
The Marine Ice Cliff Instability posits ice cliffs above a critical height collapse under their own weight, initiating runaway ice sheet retreat. We model the formation of marine ice cliffs, as an Antarctic ice shelf is removed. We show that over ice-shelf collapse timescales longer than a few days (consistent with observations), ice cliffs comprised of intact ice are more stable, undergoing viscous flow rather than brittle fracture.

**Predicting rates and distribution of carbonate melting in oceanic upper mantle: Implications for seismic structure and global carbon cycling.**
We predict how small concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> found in passively upwelling mantle throughout ocean basins may generate low-degree carbonate melting. We find the flux of CO<sub>2</sub> segregated by these melts rivals the flux from mid-ocean ridges. [Publication](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2018GL078142)
