My [research](https://fionaclerc.github.io/research) uses geodynamic models to study processes within the Earth's mantle and cryosphere, and their connections.

I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. I received a Ph.D. in Geophysics, conferred jointly by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.
